اممم،
My name is ______, I’m a cofounder and a partner in Peace Cake, which is an advertising agency/content creation company, also am the senior copyrighter at Peace Cake, and in house director.
#######################
Ok, so… we’ve been married for  5 years,
دلوقتي،
my daughter is 3, almost 3.5, she turned 3 last February. (laughs) That’s pretty much about it for now
يعني.
#######################
ummmm, extra.. (laughs)… in one word. She’s kind of a… the… sort of very perfomative.. very drama queenish… كده… she likes to put on a show for everyone, she likes to be in the spotlight, and she’s very very expressive with her face.
#######################
Uhhh, hopefully (laughs)
#######################
Umm, there’s always this thought of, I can do more, I can contribute more, I can help more,
لإن أنا
I’m always, like, I think both of us, me and my wife, we always feel like we’re not doing enough,
أنا,
honestly, I feel she’s doing much more than I am,
بس
  we’re both feeling
اللي هو
hey we can do more بس
just because how it is and how we work, and
كل الكلام ده،
we tend to be busy most of the time and just not present, ummmm.. we try to be present as much as we can, especially on the weekends,
لما بنبقى معاها يعني,
and do the best we can with… with the time we can make it (light laugh)..
#######################
ummmm, honestly, it’s been quite.. interesting for me,
عشان،
I grew up without a father…. fa it’s been… I’ve been discovering what does it mean to be a father, what does it mean to have a father… ummmm… fa just learning what I should be doing  
معاها
and being present for her and I think it boils down to just being present, being around, participating in whatever she’s into at the moment, and just being present in like her life… and I think at this point this would be the biggest, the biggest step,
لأن لسه مفيش أي حاجة
substantial that she would need me, at this point yet,
غير
just whatever minimal guidance
يعني، عن لما تكبر مثلا محتاجاني اشرحلها حاجات أو أتكلم معاها في حاجة أو كدا هو،
where I would share my experience, at this point, she’s a little younger, she just needs… my presence. I think, I feel,
أكتر من أي حاجة تانية.
#######################
اممم، كل حاجة (ضحك)، يعني
from playing around, like hide and seek and running around
و مش عارف ايه،
playing around with toys… watching TV… we recently took her to the cinema for the first time,
ده بالنسبة لي،
that was a huge ...
#######################
Yeah.. well, more exciting for me than her (laughs), but then when she got in and saw like everyone,
و مش عارف ايه ،
she got really really excited, sharing these experiences with her and sharing things that I used to love with her
، دلوقتي، يعني،
I still have a lot of my old toys, from when I was a kid, and sharing them now with her again is, is really interesting, and it’s interesting because of the world we live in,
يعني، اللي هو،
I’ve, I’ve had
مثلا
my Toy Story toys, since the first Toy Story 24 years ago…
#######################
I still have them, she’s into Toy Story now, and the 4th one just came out, so… things don’t die anymore, fa now when I share them…like
اللي هو...
Hey
#######################
It’s… it’s still relevant, and, fa, it’s interesting to me sharing... like… these childhood memories with her again,
و كدا هو،
That’s, that’s always a fun experience
#######################
The way I was raised… ummm.. my mother raised us,
أنا،
Me and my brother, I have a younger brother, ummm… to be very independent,
يعني،
I used to take care of my younger brother a lot, and she would trust us and… like trust that we would take care of ourselves…
#######################
3 years. Ummm, fa there was always a huge level of trust, and… there was… I think trust and support, are like, if I put it in two words, it would be trust and support… my mother always supported everything we wanted to do, and… and pushed us to do more, and.. and tried to make us explore our different potentials..
مش حتى
Potential
واحد،
Just potentials, as much as possible…
#######################
Yeah, try as many things as possible… you’re gonna do music, and sports, and activities and […] and … and do everything and see where you fit
في الآخر،
And there was always this level of support, and, this level of trust, of
اللي هو، انت هتعمل و هتيجي تقول لي،
And pretty much,
أنا كنت بعمل كده،
Where it was, I would tell her everything, I would share… […], up to this point still, share with her mostly everything,
ف... آه...
There’s this level of trust and support that we… developed together that I think was the most important part, growing up.
#######################
Ummm…
شوية، بس...
Not yet…I still feel that she’s too young for that…ummm,
يعني،
I don’t remember how my mom raised me at that age, because I was at that age (chuckles), fa I wouldn’t really remember much,
بس...
I think it will come into play eventually, as she gets older.
#######################
Ummm…with me, it’s mostly instinct, umm, I know with my wife it’s different.
ان هي
She…she read a lot of books… when she was pregnant, she read a lot of books, she prepared… and she’s doing a lot based on what she’s learned.
أنا
I’m basically more on instinct, and, and trying to… seeing where she wants to go and sort of nurture that, as opposed to trying to force something on her.
#######################
بالظبط،
(overlapping with interviewer) direct her in a certain direction… at least for now, it’s way too young to sort of …
#######################
box her…box her into something or the other (chuckles). Like, I know, like, the things that I’m trying to… fo…not force her…but the thinks that I’m trying to instill within her right now, would be… uhhhh…like, basic, basic stuff, that I see are wrong with the world, that I would want to eliminate. For instance… gender norms,
أو اللي هو
When she says “this is only for girls, this is only for boys”,
أو كدا هو
This is something I wanna kill (chuckles), I wanna be like…
#######################
بالظبط،
Especially,
ان هو
She would learn
في الحضانة
And she would come back and be like “ohhh..
دي بتاعة ال
Boys only..[…]”, [it’s like]
لا
You can be… whatever you want to be…
مش عارف ايه...
and it’s going to still be hard
حتى
When she grows up
في مصر ان
That’s how society is…
بس
at least if she has that mindset it would… like.. arm her against the world (chuckles).. in a certain way…ummm… we still haven’t had  discussions related to faith or religion or
كل الكلام ده، بس 
Because I believe
يعني برده
it’s still way too early to sort of get into that…ummm…
يعني
She’s aware of
ربنا و مش عارف ايه و كدا هو
Because of how we speak and how (chuckles)…
#######################
Yeah, exactly, and how our families are
كمان... ايييه، بس
I think eventually I’ll definitely start introducing that, coz it is an important part of who I am and who my wife is, and how we sort of lead our lives….
#######################
We have different parenting styles, but what I try to do is support my wife in what she wants to do…
 ان
I try to be a team player
أكتر، ان هو
I want… she… obviously has a plan, and I obviously have something in mind in how I wanna raise her, but I trust that what she wants is useful as well, so what I try to be is I try to be a team player and sort of…like
أشوف هي عايزة تعمل ايه برده 
And work around it and see how to work together as opposed to us being sort of conflicting parents (laughs), for the child…
ف
It would make sense
اللي هو
Yeah, I’d let her take the lead
شوية
In the general direction but then I’d like put in extra parts and add in my input and switch up […]
#######################
Ehhhh, we generally set the rules together… ehhh.. and decide on them,
 اللي هو
If she has a rule in mind, and we like
آه لا أصل
We need to change this
و مش عارف ايه
So we set the general rules and guidelines together, and we try to enforce them together, and sort of play back and forth and … and.. who enforces, who…
يريح شوية، كل الكلام ده.... طبعا
Grandparents are sort of the variable that ruins everything (laughs)
بس
We try to work around that…. but yeah
#######################
In, in general, during weekdays, she wakes up a bit earlier that us, she wakes up around 6:30 to 7, ehhh, our work starts around
يعني
Our hours start from 10:30 to 11:30…so we have to leave here around 9:30 to 10, she has
حضانة
Around 9. So what we do is, we wake up early, either
أنا أو رندا (الزوجة)،
Or at times when we’re blessed, when my mom is arou… my mom lives across [us]… so sometimes like my mom would take her to…
الحضانة
In the morning, or I would take her, or Randa would take her, we sort of alternate and see who’s more fit to do it in the morning (laughs), depending on what happened the night before, sometimes we work late,
و كل الكلام ده،
Ehhh, fa then, we’d wake up, spend a little time with her, and then take her to..
الحضانة،
Or if I’ve been up working late, I’ll probably just sleep through that (chuckles), fa it sort of fluctuates, and then, we finish work around 6… between 6 and 7, so by the time…
#######################
We work together, yeah, ehhh… we go together, come back together,
معظم الوقت،
Ehhh, cause we work in different departments, fa, usually different responsibilities… ehhh, fa when we come, when we come back, we come back around 7:30 to 8. If we’re back early enough, we… we spend a little time with her before bed time, and then, and then we put her to bed. We also switch bed time around,
ساعات رندا
Puts her to sleep
ساعات أنا،
If there’s no one to pick her up
من الحضانة،
Cause she finishes at 4, then either one of us would leave work early to pick her up, depending on who still has work to do, who can finish the rest from home…etc., so we alternate… ehh… someone wo pick her up. Unless, either my mother, or her parents would then pick her up
من الحضانة،
And then she would stay at either’s house
لغاية لما احنا نرجع 
To put her to bed. Sometimes, we...end up being very late, fa we sort of miss bedtime, and we come after she falls asleep. But that’s usually how the weekday goes. Ehhh, in terms of the weekend, I usually wake up
معاها الصبح
Especially on Fridays, ummm, wake up
معاها الصبح،
Spend some in the morning, we’d watch TV
شوية،
We have breakfast,
كدا هو،
And Randa would sleep in a bit, and then
بعد الصلاة
We would go do something, either we’d go out… do something together, or we’d spend the day together
هنا، مثلا
Fill up the pool
في الجنينة، اللي بيتنفخ ده
And we’d just have a fun day in,
ده في الصيف يعني (ضحك)،
Ummm, Saturday, I usually tend to, try to do more work, or get some stuff done, maybe have a couple of meetings 
أو كده، بس 
If I don’t, then it’s another day I spend with them,
بس
Friday is the main day that we try to spend together, ehhh, either just us three,
أو ساعات
My mom would join,
أو ساعات
Her parents would join,
يعني
Today they’re all at her parents’ house, cause it’s my wife’s grandma’s birthday, fa they’re all…they’re all gathered there,
ف...فكده...ف 
That’s how it works. Friday usually goes to the family, try to spend as much time with… with her…ehh…and my wife,
عشان 
when we spend time at work it doesn’t really count (laugh), and ehhh.. Saturday is when I try to get some work done if I need to, and if I don’t, then it’s more time with her. Usually…
يعني هو مش
Usually, every Saturday..morning, my wife goes to do her hair, fa that’s usually just time with me and…
#######################
One on one time
مع ... آه، مع جميلة
That’s, her scheduled, like 4 hours (laughs) of […] just her (wife) time, fa it’s… it’s sort of one on one time
مع...
#######################
Uhh, yes. Uhhh, it’s very important to spend time one on one with her, because this is the time where we usually bond, and she starts to accept uhh.. my presence and my authority,
لأن هو
If I…like I realized if I miss one on one time
كتير
Then.. she starts not wanting to spend time
معايا
And wanting to spend time with other people, either with my mom or my wife
أو كدا هو
She’d be more wanting to spend time with them than
معايا، و لما بتيجي معايا بتعيط شوية
Before she gets used to it
و كده، و بعد كده
We spend one on one time then she doesn’t want to leave me (laughs), fa it’s sort of
كده يعني ف...
I want to spend… more… like, it’s important to spend that one on one time
شوية
Cause it sort of strengthens that bond, and […]
#######################
Uhhh, I think it’s just cause the way it’s always been for me,
إن أنا
Like when I was growing up, we, like, my extended extended family,
اللي هو
My mother’s cousins… and uncles were in the same building, fa I would spend time with their kids and we all grew up together as, like, one whole family
و كده، ف..
I’m just used to that sort of environment, and… it’s important to have that bond with the rest of the family , cause I don’t want her to grow up isolated from… like everyone else, and just have us to support,
لا قدر الله لو أي حاجة حصلت،
She’d be comfortable enough to be with anyone in the family, and it’s important
برده
Cause it’s, honestly, it’s incredibly practical, in, in terms of how we live our lives right now… and how the situation is right now (chuckles),
إن هو ساعات
just.. work gets in the way and
كدا هو، ف..
just having that support system is incredibly important to be able to… to function…
لأن أنا
I can be at like a 12 hour shoot,
مش هعرف أسيبه و أسيب ال
client
و أسيب البتاع و... (ضحك بسيط)
#######################
Yeah, exactly, exactly, fa… especially like
برده يعني، رمضان مثلا
is really really awkward, cause it’s like the highest season for
إعلانات
and the highest
بتاع،
and, and, the working hours are incredibly weird
و كدا هو
as you said, it’s not a regular 9 to 5, fa I would definitely need that sort of backup… it’s like having a safety net… […]
#######################
Right now, cause it’s still
برده في الأول،
we tend, cause, all she does at this age is sort of test boundaries, and experiment with how far she can get away with things, fa we try to sort of set these boundaries and set these rules to… to be around the moral guidelines that we believe in…
فمثلا،
she would take a toy
من الحضانة
and be like “oh, it’s mine”, uhh
لا،
we know it’s not yours and you have to take it back and say I’m sorry and
كل الكلام ده،
Uhhhh, and
يعني
I’m mixing morals and manners
برده شوية، اللي هو
having to always say please and thank you, and she’s not being rude to anyone, not yell at anyone, like.. the nannies
مثلا، أو...
like, the person, that comes,
مثلا
like the gardener
لما بييجي يعمل الجنينة أو حاجة زي كده،
she’s not to be rude to them, to be nice to them, to not… be overly rude to any one person, cause she can… like if she’s throwing a tantrum
أو
she’s throwing
كدا هو
she can be rude to anyone, like starting from me, from my grandma, from… eh, the nanny…
اللي هو
she can be rude towards anyone, fa I try to be, very very strict, especially with that…
اللي هو
when she’s [in anger] that she wouldn’t like, yell at someone, and she wouldn’t hit someone, that she wouldn’t
كل الكلام ده،
cause 3 year olds, they… slap anyone (laughs) in the face, fa…
#######################
Yeah, fa this is, I think this is where I’m most strict, uhhh, coz probably I see it, I see it as a problem in me, that uhhh, I’m trying to work on,
فمش عايزها ت-
develop
عندها،
the sort of getting angry, and sort of being rude to someone
أو كدا هو، ف-
this is, I think, the strictest I am with her, is when she’s rude to other people.
#######################
Mainly, model-, definitely modeling that,
اللي هو
whenever some sort of action happens, we sort of … emphasize how she would act, like say “thank you”, say “please”, like… ehh.. […]
أو
and when she does the mistake, we usually take a stance, and make sure she understands that this is wrong, and shouldn’t be done, and there would be some sort of punishment, sort of for understanding… punishment
اللي هو، اقعدي في ال-
naughty corner
شوية
[…]… scolding…
حاجات زي كده يعني... بس...بس
yeah, we… this is something both
أنا
and my wife agreed upon,
إن هو...
even though we were raised that way, because that’s how everyone was raised
في مصر،
is we try not to have physical punishment…
خالص...
trying to sort of veer away from that… sort of… cause we understand how it’s not really the way to go (laughs).
#######################
لا،
I had that mentality, 10 years ago, where
اللي هو، اتربينا كده و كلنا زي الفل
and then slowly, I started [understanding]…. back then I was… 20 (laughs), fa it makes sense for me to [understand],
بس اللي هو
now I understand
اللي هو،
even
ان احنا كلنا اتربينا كده،
A:
ما احناش زي الفل (ضحك)
#######################
and B: ehhh, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna work out well for her. And I’ve seen enough, the people that had negative consequences
من ده
and hate their parents,
أو
they’re just not on good terms with their parents,
أو
they themselves have a lot of issues, that they need to deal with.. fa all of these problems are… something I wouldn’t want my daughter to have,
عشان
she’ll have enough problems to face (laughs)
بصراحة..
#######################
Ehhh, I think it’s a mixture of many things,
يعني
between my mother setting moral boundaries and teaching me… ehh.. religion obviously [was] a huge factor, and
مثلا
at school
برده
from teachers and stuff like that, I think it sort of coagulated
كده،
and… ehh… from sports. Like playing teams, and dealing with the team and dealing with the coach, and dealing with
كل الكلام ده...
I sort of set some … rules…and and… things of how to live your life, based on just existing with the team for such a long time, and sort of, it stays with you eventually.
#######################
Ehhh, ok, I see religion as a good guideline for, ehhh, finding out what.. where morals would be,
بس
it shouldn’t be the cause for being moral,
يعني
it’s a good guideline for morality,
بس
if religion is the only reason you’re moral, then you have a problem. Then religion doesn’t exist to just force morals on you,
أو
force…
يعني
I find religion.. ehh.. has a larger role, in sort of your spiritual identity and… and the way you see the world and.. and the way you act in the world,
بس
it shouldn’t just be, oh, these are a set of rules that I need to follow
علشان كده هو، لا
these rules are rules I would follow even if I didn’t have religion, because, this is how to be a good human being, fa these should always exist,
بس
it’s a good source of … of guidelines… like if I need a reference for where morals lie, like this is a good starting point to build from… ehhh…
بس
it shouldn’t be the sole reason for… having morals. Fa that’s why… [it’s] instilling the morals first, and then, and then… we would add the religion on top of that, as opposed to the other way around. Because… because then… like… because then, you see people that once they… lose faith,
أو، أو
stop being religious, then they also stop being moral, and start acting completely immoral and completely all over the place and…I wanna safeguard against that
برده
and teach her just how to be … a good human being, and to think for herself. ehhh…
لا قدر الله
if something happens, she loses faith,
أو
she doesn’t want to follow that path, at least she would still be… a good human being…which is,
اللي هو، نبقى، غير ان هو، كسبنا حاجة (ضحك) 
#######################
Not at first, no. And because it shouldn’t. Because,
يعني...
I think a person, like, if the only reason that’s stopping [them]
مثلا
from stealing or murdering people, is because your religion… because you’re religious, then… there’s a problem there. I mean it’s good that you’re still not killing people,
بس اللي هو
maybe… rethink killing people (laughs)…
#######################
It’s incredibly important for me, that she would retain the same faith as me,
بس
I wouldn’t love her any less, or shun her if she doesn’t,
يعني
I would be…understanding, I wouldn’t be happy,
بس
I would understand. Because at the end of the day, the more I see people forcing religion on.. on their children, the further the children have veered from religion.
#######################
This is like, like, whenever I see, like, the…the most ardent of atheists, come from the most religious of parents. And I think that’s
برده
because like, the parents have this very strict view of…how religion should be, that the children believe that any other way of practicing religion is wrong… unless it’s exactly like their parents, and they despise that certain way, fa then they choose to not have a religion at all. As opposed to… looking at religion objectively and seeing… what would fit for them, and, and how they would practice it, how it fit them, for them to be comfortable, and eventually grows and…
و الإيمان بيقوى و يضعف، و
we all go through struggles with it,
بس اللي هو
it’s better to… just not be something incredibly strict and forced,
فأنا
I always feel choked by it, and rather just have it, have it a more flexible thing that you would embrace and feel like it’s a part of you, even if you’re going to be the least practitioner,
بس
at least you’d would have…
#######################
بالظبط،
part of it, yeah. Fa it’s…
أضعف الإيمان، زي ما [بيقولوا] (ضحك)
#######################
بالظبط،
exactly, it’s that, that superficial performative part of religion as opposed to the actual core, of… there are people who probably believe in God
جدا، و كدا هو، بس...
don’t have the strength or willpower
ان هم مثلا... يصلوا
regularly
أو حاجات زي كده،
and… they always feel bad because society are like…
آه، كدا هو، بس يا جماعة كل ابن آدم خطاء (ضحك)...
like who, literally, who are we, who are we to judge?
اللي هو، ربنا ذات نفسه قال "إنا إلينا إيابهم ثم إنا علينا حسابهم"، ف-
it’s that sort of philosophy that I try to… that I try to follow pretty much, because… like you’ve seen how that performative side is also… not very useful in raising the child. 
يعني
the biggest example right now, which is in the current zeitgeist is… Amr Warda (laughs)…
#######################
The serial sexual harasser, and, and… one of the most famous things about his father, who was a big basketball player
في...في الاتحاد السكندري،
and who’d helped them win, in the winning game against, in like an African tournament,
مع الاتحاد السكندري،
ehh…back then basketball players wore shorts that were this short (pointing on leg higher above the knee), he wore shorts that went all the way down (beyond knees), like, like today’s basketball shorts, but that wasn’t the norm back then. He wore really really long shorts, and he always had a long beard,
و لما كسب البطولة رفع المصحف ما رفعش الكأس. ف-
he had that huge, sort of superficial, performative, religion.
بس
it obviously did not help with his son, who’s a serial sexual harasser.
#######################
Exactly, which is even worse. Like you’re, you’re giving religion a bad name. You’re not helping his case, you’re just worsening other cases. Fa… that’s sort of like an example
كدا هو، في النور،
in front of people,
بس
you can find a lot more examples, of that, the strict parents that are just incredibly religious, and sort of force it on their kids and then… because their kids don’t know any better, and because their kids cannot understand the world outside of the… the rigid religious sort of point of view that their parents forced upon them, they start acting out, and going in directions that are incredibly… wrong,
زي مثلا
Warda’s case, which is harassment.
#######################
آه بالظبط.
#######################
No, we’re there. She’s going to school… next… in September.
#######################
Ok, so there was a huge discussion 
في الأول،
cause my wife believes that French and German schools are incredibly strong
في مصر،
and she wanted to take her to one of these. I honestly believe that education in schools especially
في مصر،
only 50% happens in the school, and the other 50% happens at home. Ummm, the way I was raised, like, my mother would study
معايا،
she would help me out with studying
و كل الكلام ده.
If she went to a French school, I am completely out, I do not know a word of French, I even studied German in school. If she went to a German school, still, doing Math and Science in German for me would be [hard], fa for me it was very important for her to have a school that sort of taught in the same language I’m used to, so I can help her out.. with whatever she might need, because like I believe a large part that I’m going to be playing is during her education sort of in partly…
اللي هو قشطة أنا اتخرجت
engineering, I might not be working with it,
بس
at least I have working knowledge of Math and Science that would help her at least [in] studying (laughs), fa that was a huge part for me. Ehhh, my  wife was raised in between South Africa and England, fa… to her […] once you decide on English, then she decided, for her a British school was the most important,
علشان خاطر
it’s the closest to her experience and she does not trust the local experience… I had no…
يعني أنا أنا
I was completely local experience,
كنت في مدرسة عادي دخلت ثانوية عامة حتى و خلصت و كل حاجة،
[but] it was a completely local experience,
بس أنا
I don’t mind, it’s ok, if you feel this is better, then sure, let’s… let’s go…I just put my foot down in the language barrier so I can help out,
بس
other than that… fa we decided on…on a British school, and then it all fell down to
بقى
price point, because schools are insanely expensive, fa… we chose one that was not super crazy expensive, but still offered the sort of education system that … we liked… fa we chose
ال-
British School of Rehab, that’s also close by..
#######################
Yeah, that was also very important for her, cause, like I think she still doesn’t believe in buses, and school buses,
يعني
[…] my daughter has never went on a school trip
مع الحضانة
cause she believes she’s too young for getting on the bus…
#######################
آه،
and solo trips
و كده،
and, and , I’m trying to convince her that, when she goes to school, she’s gonna… she’s gonna have to get on the school bus,
بس
it’s because her father was a little extra paranoid, fa he drove them to school every day. Whereas,
يعني
some of my closest friends I’ve made, on the school bus. (laughs)
#######################
The school bus is an experience, you, you… build lasting [relationships] cause, cause these are people you spend time with outside of… school, just going, coming
من المدرسة
we’d spend like 45 to an hour, 45 minutes to an hour in the bus, these are prime bonding (laughs) hours,
فبصراحة
I feel the bus would be both beneficial for her and making friends and
كدا هو،
and incredibly convenient (laughs),
بس
at least the school is closeby, fa if there’s ever something, and they ever need us, then we’d always…then
آه
#######################
بالظبط.
yeah
#######################
For me, it was how I could help her to… while she’s… she’s going through the school experience. For my wife, it was a very close experience to the one she had growing up, she wanted to replicate that as much as possible, and… proximity. Proximity is important for my wife as well, for me not as much.
أنا كنت بروح ال
BBC
كانت في بلبيس و بعد كده كنت بروح هنا في التجمع و أنا كنت في مدينة نصر، فبالنسبة لي
just having a school far away is the norm for me, like I’ve never had that school next to the house experience, fa it wasn’t really that big of a deal,
بس
like I understand the benefits of it being close by, fa I didn’t really.. matter.
#######################
I don’t think I’ll leave everything just for the school, uhhh,
يعني
she’ll learn the curriculum, she’ll learn the basics of everything,
بس
then again, like I remember from… from my school experience that whatever we learned at school, I eventually learned was either missing some stuff or outdated. Fa, it’s going to be our job to sort of catch her up to what’s actually happening in the world as opposed to… because the curriculums aren’t really regularly updated, fa the information could be a bit dated or a bit old, fa it’s just that, sort of …hey,
خللي بالك لا،
this is…
يعني
for instance if they’re still learning about the nine planets , it’s like hey by the way, Pluto was not a planet for a while, and then maybe they’re trying to bring it back and there’s a whole thing, cause these are things that are interesting and sort of puts things into perspective with the world she’s living in
أكتر،
and she becomes more… cause a lot of information, of sort of the general trivia information that I have today, are stuff that stuck with me from back in the school days. Like not a lot of people have that retention,
بس
for me it was that kinda thing, like a lot of things I remember, I remember from school,
بس مثلا، اللي هو
I remember when we took like the basic unit measurements of how like the meter is sort of like a bar in… like a museum in France
و كل الكلام ده،
and how like now, advances are like this is being changed into… like measurements by light
و كدا هو،
and the last, the last one that was still a physical thing was the kilogram, and they finally changed. Fa to me this is something that I would like to impart on her, because I’m pretty sure that the science books would still have that whole gold bar in[France]… radium bar in France thing. (laughs)
#######################
Complement, exactly. Especially, especially when it comes to history, and especially when it comes to like really really recent history, cause I know that this was completely…
#######################
Recent Egyptian history, yes. It was, like, I know for a fact that the history books that whatever they’re teaching the kids today, is going to be an abomination, and we lived through these events. And we know exactly what happened, and we know how things have changed, and she should be aware of that, and just not, just fed, not like how we were raised where
آه، أصل حسني مبارك صاحب أول ضربة جوية،
it was, it was 30 years ago, fa it was, it was pretty far, but this, it’s fresh…
#######################
We were there, exactly, fa this would be incredibly important to make her aware,
بس
also incredibly important to not make her challenge the teachers and
كدا هو،
cause it could get her or us, into trouble, because … it’s not… it’s really not safe for anyone at this point,
بس
yeah..
######################
The curricula from school, yeah, would be the basic sort of building block that we build upon, and then…
أنا
I would like to supplement her education beyond what she takes in school in terms of music, and sports. Because these were very important to me growing up, and… I think they’re very important in how I developed as a person… uhhh, and I would like her to have that experience as well.
#######################
Ok, ehhh, for music itself, music itself has been beneficial in my life, in terms of
حتى
my career, and a lot of things…
فده،
and just having a sense for the arts and being able to create.. cause music is part art, and part practice, and there’s a lot of science that goes into music in particular, as opposed to any other art… uhhh, cause it’s more like a language… that you learn and practice… ehhh, and it sort of shapes the way you think and shapes the way you feel about the world, in a certain way, that’s sort of… it just adds another dimension to your perspective, and that’s incredibly, incredibly useful. And… I’d like to eventually want to play music with my daughter (laughs), which would be…
#######################
Exactly, which is not a bad thing to have. Uhhh… as for sports, even in, in, like, cause I played solitary sports most of my life, but we were always a team… The longest sport I ever played was
فروسية،
I spent like, I spent 12 years doing that,
بس
we were always a team, and we were always… like that team was like a family, and learning about having a family that isn’t particularly blood, like a family… you’re bonded by another interest, you’re bonded by something else, that was incredibly important growing up, that I always had that, like even if I did not have that much friends at school, or I would be bullied at school, I still have another group of friends that are really really my friends, because we all played the same sport together, and we all compete together, and we’re all doing…so I always that backup to fall back on… ehhh… and…I think just,
يعني
in my particular case
في الفروسية
like how to deal with, with the horse, and leading him through things, I believe, benefited me a little bit more, in sort of how I would lead, ehhh.. lead people or just deal with them… ehh.. not…
يعني...
I didn’t really put [bits] and reins on people (laughs)
بس
sort of that, sort of…
#######################
A lot easier (laughs).
بس
it’s still like… it gives you that mindset of
إن، ازاي تعرف تسايس حاجة
cause communicating with an animal’s incredibly hard, fa it just makes communication with people a little bit easier (laughs).
#######################
Fa, fa, yeah, fa I think… and honestly, ehhh, even though I played sports growing up my entire life, and grew up with this culture of having to exercise regularly, like for half of my life, I still ended up.. (laughs) ehhh, overweight, [because] like once we got into work and couldn’t work out as much
و كدا هو،
I ended up with… health issues, and... I would not want my daughter to go through that, or at least I would want to guard her against that… ehhh.. fa [I] try to instill that culture or exercise a little bit more and hopefully it sticks with her a little bit longer than it did with me.
#######################
With her school and teachers?
#######################
Uhhhh, right now, I’m not as involved,
مع
her teachers
في الحضانة
just cause I have no idea what they do
في الحضانة
like what are you teaching them, there’s no real like physical thing that she’s learning at this point yet,
بس
I think once we go into… like regular school
أكتر
and I’m more involved in what she’s learning, and… and the details of the content of her education, I think I’ll be more… more involved, or I’d want to be more involved. Uhhh, I remember was a huge trouble maker, so my mom would send me to the parents’ meeting instead of her, because the teachers were all my friends, cause, like I went…like I was taught by the same teachers, but 3 years earlier, so I would just go and like, oh well, I know my brother, just give me, I’ll… I’ll communicate it to my mom (laughs), cause my mom at one point, at one point, my mom was like
مش قادرة أروح أتهزأ من كل المدرسين تاني (ضحك)، فروح انت و ابقى احكيلي (ضحك)،ف-
I sort have that experience a little bit from that, ehhh,
بس
I believe like, once we go into that, I’ll be much more involved. uhhh… because it would be much more substantial, like, there will be actual stuff to do, as opposed to
دلوقتي،
where it’s like “she was great at dancing”, alright (laughs).
#######################
Yes, absolutely. And especially to understand how she acts with… people who aren’t her parents, and they’re pretty much the only eyes outside of…outside of the house that would sort of see that, and… and experience it. [But] it would give us another perspective.
