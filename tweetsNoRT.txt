Love someone pointing out to Eloise her privilege! Sick of her just running off at the mouth not realizing she has the protection of her money and family #Bridgerton2 #Bridgerton
The amount of times is yelled at Anthony and Kate to JUST KISS ALREADY is ridiculous now. #Bridgerton 🥺😩

Anthony, you are a damn idiot #Bridgerton
#Bridgerton 

J’ai vraiment aimé.
Having read all the #Bridgerton books they made Edwina so clueless.
See, this is why I did not care for book Penelope. 🤷🏻‍♀️Sis seemed more concerned about her gossiping rag than her own best friend. That "you again" energy.... The show seems to just emphasize it more and making her look mercenary. #Bridgerton https://t.co/RkffzMiOsj
watching #Bridgerton while snuggling a baby = my perfect Friday night 😌♥️
I surely cannot be expected to wait a whole year for the next season of #Bridgerton

#bridgerton2 was quite slow, it dragged but overall the Viscount held his own. The Duke's presence was certainly missed

ALSO, let me preface this watch with the caveat that The Viscount Who Loved Me is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the books. Read it multiple times. This could work out amazing or be an issue? idk idk. LET’S GOOOOOO #Bridgerton
Edwina looks way too young for Anthony #Bridgerton

Ugh. This whole love triangle between Anthony, Edwina, and Kate is annoying AF. #Bridgerton

Give us the Duke! This season is not the same without him #Bridgerton

Me desculpem do fundo do coração mas não vou ficar calada, EU ODIEI com todas as forças essa situação edwina, kate e Anthony, chegar onde chegou, o relacionamento delas como irmãs, a Mary, eu achei decepcionante, mas vida q segue. Bora continuar #Bridgerton

Sorry but yes 😩

#Bridgerton https://t.co/nC0lvSbH8y
I love them #Bridgerton https://t.co/XZz7jQIlec
Ok ok ok #Bridgerton fans- just so you know the bee and the office scene in the book was SOOOOOO much spicier https://t.co/Q9nSPH7RDV
I did it! I did nothing but binge #Bridgerton season 2 today and it was glorious! Okay, maybe not as good as season 1. And I liked the sisterly relationship more in the books. But a solid season 2 for arguably my least favorite Bridgerton boy.
As caras do Anthony durante o jogo, aplaudindo, mas por dentro querendo matar a Kate, exatamente como eu imaginava lendo.

Jonathan, vc tá fazendo tudo!

Today I had a nagging headache so I worked out since I can’t take naproxen &amp; watched #bridgerton2 I’ve read all the #Bridgerton books including the epilogues and Violet’s story. I ♥️ it. It made me cry &amp; Kathi is brilliant, Anthony doesn’t deserve her #RomanceReaders https://t.co/CMOYp5fuRx
While it's a huge departure... I really want to see a side story next season with Edwina and her new husband!😂😂😂 #Bridgerton

E eu que achei que eles seguiriam o padrão da primeira temporada e fariam uma boa adaptação... fui trouxa mais uma vez 🤡o melhor livro da série jogado no lixo. #Bridgerton
Me quedan por ver los dos últimos capítulos de #Bridgerton 😭
Mi humilde opinión sobre el capítulo 1 de la 2da temporada ase #Bridgerton es que va demasiado rápido todo y hasta marea que pasan bruscamente de una escena a otra.
Terminei de assistir a 2° temporada de #Bridgerton achei ok. A primeira foi absolutamente bem melhor, o que salvou mesmo foi Anthony e a Kate pq as outras histórias foi bem bléh.
#Bridgerton FOLLIAAAAAAA

eu amo ver a kate e a edwina se chamando de bon e didi #Bridgerton
I get it they’re longing &amp; pining for each other, but what they tried to execute, it just falls short. It’s not giving what it’s supposed to give. Like I’m 5 episodes in and I just don’t see it. Will see if the chemistry will get better in the later episodes. #Bridgerton
this scene with kate in the library with her hair down and the white nightgown, looking absolutely LUMINOUS?? simone ashley is the most beautiful person living #Bridgerton
Terceiro episódio e eu cheia de ódio ainda, EU QUERO ESSE CHRIS NA CADEIA #Bridgerton
Watching #Bridgerton and in one of the pivotal ball scenes they’re playing the classical cover of, “Dancing On My Own.” All I can think of is how @banjoe77 feels about this song.

A me sarebbe piaciuto che inserissero anche il vero motivo per cui Anthony non voleva un matrimonio d'amore, cioè la sua paura di morire, ma tutto sommato è un adattamento diverso e per chi non ha letto il libro risulta molto piacevole #Bridgerton
The way ‘you oughta know’ was used got me 😭 #Bridgerton

Lady Mary really be an absent mother huh… we on episode 5 and I be thinking Kate really did raise this child #Bridgerton

#Bridgerton Agora vou de elogio:
A cena dos criados enchendo o Anthony de perguntas qnd o cadáver do pai ainda nem esfriou, enquanto a Violet grávida está desesperada na escada foi extremamente bem feita e transmitiu todo o terror q o Tony e mãe passaram naquele dia horrível.
ไหนๆก็ปรับบทจากหนังสือไปหมดละ ฉาก climax จะขยี้แบบให้เคทความจำเสื่อม ไม่เหลือความทรงจำเกี่ยวกับแอนโทนี่เลยก็ได้นะ แบบตื่นมาแล้วเกลียดขี้หน้าไอ้หมอนี่จังเลย แล้วให้แอนโทนี่ตามจีบตามง้อ ทำให้เคทกลับมาหลงรักอีกครั้งให้ได้ไรงี้ จะฟินมาก😂 #Bridgerton #bridgertonseason2 #Kanthony

can #Bridgerton just be the kathony show? idc about anyone else anymore. they are top tier. i'm obsessed. they are the moment.
Maybe I’m bitter, maybe I’m tied to the book, but I don’t like this Edwina 🤭

#Bridgerton
a edwina dos livros JAMAIS jogaria na cara da kate que elas não são totalmente irmãs, assim como a eloise dos livros JAMAIS diria que desprezava a penelope. simplesmente colocaram esse tipo de palavras pesadas nos dois relacionamentos mais saudáveis da série.

#Bridgerton
😭😭bruh can they just kiss !!! All this tension isn’t necessary #Bridgerton
Personally I like the version of the book where Edwina had feelings for someone else and wasn’t so angry at Kates love for Anthony. #Bridgerton

That blue dress Kate is wearing in episode 1 is stunning. #Bridgerton
When I heard the Duke wasn’t coming back I told myself I wasn’t gonna watch #Bridgerton again… Fast forward today I’m hooked with the energy #Kate and #Edwina bring to the show 
#ShondaRhimes did it again ‼️‼️ https://t.co/VNVS8DVvaT
Lo mejor de los #Bridgerton es que te ponen Wrecking Ball o cualquier otra canción actual adaptada a una melodía clásica y se marcan un baile de época.

eu acho que eles pegaram pesado nas mudanças com a edwina, na vdd achei o ep do casamento bem farofa demais, mas acho que o último ep compensa com uns díalogos tão bons que passa um corretivo por cima disso #Bridgerton

Agora eu entendi a decepção de alguns fãs com essa temporada. #Bridgerton
You know there’s not a sicker burn than talking trash about how someone prepares their tea #Bridgerton

Nossa, eu já sofria com os flashbacks da morte do Edmund, vendo assim tá me acabando 😭😭😭

Not her coming up with a Ponzi scheme. #Bridgerton

Y'all couldn't just sit there an eat your gooseberry sauce. #Bridgerton https://t.co/hp4nWus1YO
#Bridgerton Another thing I took issue with is Eloise and her absolute hate for the generalized society. I get that she's supposed to be an adolescent girl in this season and the one prior, so I hope that they'll let her mature with time and become less judgmental, more empathic.
And we thought #MyGirl was traumatic. #Bridgerton
god she is so fine.... #Bridgerton https://t.co/Rrdywuq0tS
Eloise being a giant anxious mess at all the parties 😭 felt 100% #Bridgerton
ok but if I was Edwina and some dude played my sister in front of me and hurt her feelings, I'd be like ok fuck off forever goodbye #Bridgerton
That man brought her a HORSE 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂 #Bridgerton

i prefer courtship storylines over "we're married and established" storylines so season 2 was absolutely 10000% my jam. LOVED THIS SEASON. LOVE KATHONY. #Bridgerton
Bro #Bridgerton is wild!!! I’m tired of a the sister and Anthony 🙃
Why, hello Benedict #Bridgerton! Looking forward to seeing more of you in Season 3.
Second season of #Bridgerton may have been better than the first. No regrets spending all day binge watching it. 😌
Q ódio do Antony conversando com os homens sobre as mulheres #Bridgerton
#bridgerton i forgot that atia from hbo's rome was in this
First episode got me n Nesh shook😳 #Bridgerton
A segunda temporada de #Bridgerton se desenvolveu de forma muito mais coerente e fiel às personalidades dos personagens do que o livro foi, mas vocês não estão prontos pra essa conversa.
Me depecionei com a segunda #Bridgerton a Kate o o Antonhy são tá superiores nos livros

MANO DESDE DE QUANDO TEM ESSA RIVALIDADE ENTRE KATE E EDWINA?????? CARALHA, KATE NÃO MERECIA ESSE CIRCO NÃO #Bridgerton
E vamos de #Bridgerton https://t.co/PngVaeupRH
Eloise tá um saco essa temporada #Bridgerton
Acabei de pegar um spoiler lindo de #Bridgerton 😒
Finally time to start #Bridgerton season 2! ❤️
MINHAS CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS
PS.: Meu Kathony tem vida caramba #Bridgerton

Pontos negativos:

- Como leitora, não gostei da extensão que teve o noivado de Anthony e Edwina, afinal (se eu for olhar pelos livros) ele não deveria nem existir, assim como os sentimentos dela por ele.
I need to marry Benedict Bridgerton 🥺#Bridgerton
season 2 was so much better than season 1 imo. enemies to lovers, pining, stolen glances, forbidden love, inability to communicate... ALL TROPES I LOVE. #Bridgerton
I'm trying to watch season 2 of #Bridgerton but it's not the same 🤦🏽‍♀️
Daphne knows what’s up lol #Bridgerton https://t.co/8YAZkckTHf
A ver, pongámonos serios, que llevo tres capítulos y aquí todavía no ha habido mucha "trama" #Bridgerton

The way we had a Merlin reunion but at the same time, we didn't. 🥲 #Bridgerton
I love Eloise so much #Bridgerton
vcs tem noção do quão significativa foi a cena de kate ajudando anthony c a crise da panico por causa da picada ao inves dele sendo obrigado a casar pq foi pego beijando as teta dela tentando sugar o ferrão de uma abelha? VELHO #Bridgerton #BridgertonSeason2
Esto ha dolido #Bridgerton
WE WANT TO KNOW…Thoughts on @netflix #Bridgerton Season 2? 
👍 or 👎 #designlifekids #Netflix #binge #ABridgertonAffair #episode
#Bridgerton better get me together
#Bridgerton is making me sob
When will things kick up this szn?! #Bridgerton
Y mi escena de Kate y Anthony en la biblioteca??????? #Bridgerton
Ya he acabado me ha gustado mucho me da igual que hayan cambiado cosas y la química me mata la verdad #Bridgerton
Anthony is so guarded because he has to be. He had to become a man when he was still a boy. He compartmentalized his feelings and built walls to survive. #Bridgerton
⚠️SPOILER⚠️

qual foi do colin ter ido visitar a marina???????? so vou passar raiva nessa serie???? #Bridgerton

Cadê Benophie? Cadeeeeeeeê?
if I finish #Bridgerton in one sitting no one better judge
La química que manejaron Jonathan y Simone es tremendaaaaaaa!!! #Bridgerton
Na ficção #Bridgerton a líder da reunião feminista media 2x2...
even though we didn't get to see them get married, i love seeing them post-marriage #Bridgerton
That violin version of dancing with myself is just divine #Bridgerton
I started watching #Bridgerton    season 2 and I thought that song sounds familiar during the ball... they played the orchestra version of Material Girl by Madonna 🤣
the fact that it started storming and kate wasn’t paralyzed with fear under the library desk AND they changed her trauma for why she’s scared of storms 😭. literally the only book scene i truly wanted was the library scene and anthony comforting kate during the storm #Bridgerton
I can’t wait to watch Lady Bustitdown. #Bridgerton
essa temporada na vdd era um episódio de what if do livro 

"E se o Anthony e a Kate não fossem pegos no jardim na cena da abelha?" 

Já resolvi o enigma #Bridgerton #BridgertonSpoilers #bridgertonnetflix #bridgerton2 #bridgertonseason2
Não entendo tanto hate em #Bridgerton .Eu adorei as mudanças, todas muito coerentes com o contexto e com a personalidade dos personagens. O desenvolvimento da Edwina valeu milhões, achei inclusive que a forma como as coisas aconteceram foram muito mais coerentes que no livro.
Colin Bridgerton belíssimo nessa temporada de #Bridgerton nunca havia reparado
If we’re not going in order, I want Colin to really see Pen by next season #Bridgerton https://t.co/O6ElQNP7Sy

Not nearly enough Newton content smh #Bridgerton
I’m on Episode 5 of Bridgerton and although the series is good so far, I’m just not buying the chemistry between Kate and Lord Bridgerton. There’s no spark and just not bringing the heat like Daphne and Duke of Hastings, you know? Am I the only one feeling this way? #Bridgerton
The second season of Bridgerton has dropped…

Oh no, it stopped working on my phone too! Still works on the iPad. Is the bee leaving us? Was it one day only? I feel like Marty McFly holding the photo as his family fades away 😭 Maybe it was emoji Bridgerdoon #Bridgerton

Tô ansiosa mano pra ler o livro da história de Penelope e Cole sério eu tô muito sedentaaa #Bridgerton
I didnt really see much in Anthony last season. I LOVE that we are peeling back the layers and seeing his depth. #Bridgerton
Estoy iniciando la 2da temporada de #Bridgerton 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤😏👑
🤤
resumindo minha opinião sobre a s2 de #Bridgerton:
química impecável entre kate e anthony 
benedict bridgerton continua sendo o amor da minha vida
interações perfeitas entre anthony e os caçulas 
todo o resto foi péssimo 😗
Benedict is high as hell 🤣 #Bridgerton
Kate ain’t deserve this… why did the show runners do this to her #Bridgerton
Just watched Bridgerton S02 | E04: Victory #bridgerton https://t.co/DdLd26TYam #tvtime https://t.co/CgAHdXRQat
mano, o anthony é tão charmoso que eu ia ficar encantada com ele rapidinho pff #Bridgerton

Amei a abelhinha #Bridgerton
Minha irmã me forçou a assistir os primeiros capítulos de os #Bridgerton ... Logo eu, que amei cada livro que li... Sou fã de carteirinha da Julia Quinn...

Mas estou ODIANDO o que a Shonda tá fazendo com a série. 👎🏾

Os atores q fazem Anthony e Kate tem 0 química.

Credo 😖 https://t.co/vGX2Sa7i9m
Watching #Bridgerton
so soon after watch #TheGildedAge reminds me that we are living in the best of all times for TV shows.
Watching Season 2 of #Bridgerton and am absolutely appalled at how they treat their jewelry. The diamond necklace in Season 1, the bangles in Season 2... Scandalous.
eu quero AGRADECER quem fez o instrumental de how deep is your love pq eu tava completamente FORA DE MIM #Bridgerton
The first #Bridgerton episode of season 2 including Madonna’s Material Girl is just *chef’s kiss*
Porra fomos muito otarios de pensar que ia ter baile de máscaras no final viu kkkkkkkk #Bridgerton
Viendo la nueva temporada de #Bridgerton 😬
“You do not count.” 😯 #Bridgerton
why do we see tit but not dick? #Bridgerton
Acabei o primeiro episódio de #Bridgerton e do jeito que fizeram seria impossível que a Heloísa não desconfiasse do segredo da Penélope
Shouldn't the Featheringtons be in mourning colors? #Bridgerton
i’m only on episode one of season two of @bridgerton and i’m already eagerly awaiting all the songs @abigailbarloww and @mlebear write for kate and antony that’s all #Bridgerton
#Bridgerton season 2 definitely isn't about the sex as was season 1 lol but I'm only on the 3rd episode
A Kate incarnado o Antony #Bridgerton

The way Violet Bridgerton and Lady Danbury was like egging on Edwina and Anthony and then at the end of ep5 looked like she regretted it like sis 😵‍💫😵‍💫 #Bridgerton
Poor Eloise! She’s trying so hard to not make a match this season, but I totally hope she falls for that newsie from the alley! @bridgerton #Bridgerton
Two down. Do I go for a third episode to night? #Bridgerton
Oh, Pen. 😢 #Bridgerton #Bingerton
Listen. Imma need there to be a #Bridgerton podcast on the #QueenCharlotte wigs &amp; hairstylist alone! 🔥🔥✊🏽✊🏽
Anyway, my next day off I’ll binge season 2 hehe #Bridgerton
Começar a segunda temporada de Bridgerton
Aí que emoção
#Bridgerton #bridgertonseason2
Edwina looks like an actual doll come to life.
#Bridgerton
é tão ruim quando vc passa o dia maratonando uma série ai depois tem q voltar pra realidade aff #Bridgerton
Episode3 😭😭😭😭 #Bridgerton
I have never hated the neigh of a horse so much in my life. #Bridgerton
Antony pedindo a mão de Edwina enquanto Kate olha prós dois assim #Bridgerton https://t.co/NgumFitsyo
When you watch #Bridgerton and your bf sits down for a few minutes but then gets invested 😂😂😂
I love the enemies to lovers &amp; forbidden love trope. The stolen glances, the hurling of harsh words to hide how they feel, the feel of so close yet so far, their faces are touching, but barely a kiss. Goosebumps. Kate and Anthony are now my fav #Bridgerton pairing
Shonda!!!!!!!! Por que juntas las tramas del 2do y 4to libro en la 2T? #Bridgerton https://t.co/isRpgHGVeK
Anthony is a typical man. After him done whore out himself him a talk bout him want perfection 🤨 #Bridgerton
ANTHONY WAS GOING TO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND SIBLING??!!!!! #Bridgerton
i was mad at first because the duke and daphne didn’t have enough screen time but i am now mad because i want more kate and anthony 🥲🥲 #Bridgerton
Not they acting like the door isn’t open #Bridgerton
Ugh lowkey mad they didn’t show Simon and Daphne scenes while she was pregnant. Would of loved to see an hour long ep of just that 😩 #Bridgerton
ela é grandona e cadelinha no off não é atoa que ela é minha 
personagem favorita do meu livro favorito da série 
#Bridgerton https://t.co/2UGr6JeHv3
Not these women speaking five languages, playing three instruments, and can sew an entire closet yet still have to be interviewed by men for marriage.
#Bridgerton
vei como assim tinha gente puta c a cena da abelha só pq não foi igual aos livros quando foi MUITO MELHOR? mano o anthony tendo uma crise da panico e kate cuidando dele &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ele beijando os peito dela mano foi mt SUPERIOR e mt mais significativo #Bridgerton #BridgertonSeason2
O papinho de vcs agora: "ah pq toda adaptação é diferente"
Normal People é 99% fiel ao livro e é magnífica! Não tentem justificar o que não tem justificativa! #Bridgerton
My mother forgot #Bridgerton released today. Now I have to wait until tomorrow to watch past the first episode.

I JUST WANT MY ANTHONY.
Que série maravilhosa 
😍😍😍#Bridgerton
La escena de la abeja de #Bridgerton es todo lo que esta bien 👁👄👁

Se o nome do neném de Daphne fosse mesmo Amélio seria um nome mais bonito sinceramente 👀 #Bridgerton
não consigo expressar a minha decepção com essa nova temporada dos #Bridgerton sério, o que fizeram? a bagunça, as brigas sem fundamento, as problemáticas nesse roteiro que cagou pro romance... que horror.
"You are Pen. You do not count. You are my friend." 
The way he threw Penelope in the friendzone... that had to hit her so hard in her belly. #Bridgerton
KATHONY DANCING TOGETHER TO THE INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF 'DANCING ON MY OWN' BYEEEE #Bridgerton
When the Queen said she would crush Eloise like a serpent I was like 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾#Bridgerton
Didi should’ve told Bon from jump that she liked Anthony instead of being rude and manipulative to hide it #Bridgerton #bridgerton2
Just sitting here watching #Bridgerton for hours with my Bestie @river_maid how made me feel a bit better 😊
This is why I don’t do slowburn 😩😩 #Bridgerton
Bueno, me termine toda la segunda temporada de #Bridgerton hoy, y como no tengo nada mas que hacer, hare un hilo de mis opiniones que nadie pidio.

Comencemos:
Anyone else think this season of #Bridgerton is kind of meh compared to the first season?
#Bridgerton EU AMO UMA SÉRIE MANO DO CÉU
BENEDICT ON DRUGS AHHHHHHHH SUCH A CUTIE #Bridgerton
não lembro quase nada do livro, só da abelha kkkkk #Bridgerton
“I am a woman.”
“You are Pen. You do not count.” 
yeah that hurt #Bridgerton https://t.co/jsYwr9ZQVg
Ms Kate spicyyy I like her #Bridgerton
I was very late in watching season 1 of #Bridgerton because I assumed it to be over hyped. When I did actually watch it, I enjoyed it. And now I binged season 2 the day it dropped. I call that character growth. Also, the 2nd season is equally enjoyable; a light and fun watch.
Watching #Bridgerton and painting my nails a rainbow 🌈 for #Pride even though I’m too sick to walk in the parade tomorrow with our local #PFLAG - my kids and hubby are still marching. #TransIsBeautiful
I do feel for Lady Featherington.
#Bridgerton
Sério, eu perdoo a Netflix por mudar o enredo do livro por razões de: FICOU MELHOR AINDA! #Bridgerton
I've just watched episode S02 | E03 of Bridgerton! #bridgerton https://t.co/fsDBB4Ctm0 #tvtime https://t.co/mWrhk2hfEp
You can't keep your eyes off her at dinner, your sister sees all #Bridgerton #bridgerton2
Lol lady featherington is trash.. but we knew that. #Bridgerton
I knew that s2 would be amazing
Cause the same is with the books
The Viscount who loved me is so amazing

#Bridgerton
Wow I watched this all day #Bridgerton
ถ้าใครได้อ่านนิยายมาก่อนก็คงจะเฟลแหล่ะเนอะ เพราะแกนหลักของเรื่อง อย่าง กลัวผึ้ง กลัวฟ้าคะนอง กลัวตาย และการต้องแต่งงานกับเคท ฉากสำคัญอย่าง ห้องสมุด คืนเข้าหอ ผึ้งในสวน หายไปหมดเลย ถ้าทำตามนิยายมันคงจะสนุกกว่านี้และเอ็ดวินาก็ใจดีและมีเหตุผลกว่านี้แน่นอน #Bridgerton #bridgerton2

I just finally got to finish #Bridgerton and honestly, I'm gonna need a rewatch ASAP to take all of that in. Like honestly, it was EVERYTHING I wanted from the TVWLM but none of what I had in my head. It was exquistie. Never have I seen the slow burn and yearning executed so well
Binge watching #Bridgerton while cuddling my cow plushie can life get any better

You guys have no idea 

#Bridgerton
I understand the added made up bits about random characters FINE but changing the personality of characters is so annoying to me especially since it is a series based on a book! The ppl that read the book want to visualize what they read tf 😤💀 #Bridgerton
Took a slight break from #Bridgerton for #DragRace but I'm back now😁 episode 3 here we go!!!!
ANTHONY JEALOUS ERAAAA #bridgerton
Newton is adorable! #Bridgerton

Anthony complaining about a gatekeeping sister after his behavior with Daphne last season #Bridgerton https://t.co/V1d3fh9nru
Okay but WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN ELOISE’S SEASON #Bridgerton
omg anthony telling kate that he loves her and he knows she won't accept it bc she's stubborn af #Bridgerton
I love the music on here. MATERIAL GWORL #Bridgerton
Series 2 of #Bridgerton was OK but preferred series 1. That said I thinkI preferred book 2 to book one when I actually listened to them. Also they've changed too much of Lady W's story.
If all my panic attacks ended in an almost kiss...#Bridgerton
Que saudades estava das músicas pop versões música clássica. 

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa #Bridgerton
Penelope in the market like

A Rainha já jogou umas lenhas nessa fogueira #BridgertonSpoilers #Bridgerton https://t.co/ZGK7yxLn95
I feel like the only one who has no problem knowing who Lady Whistledown is Penelope lol. That was obvious in season 1 before it was even exposed. #Bridgerton
Just discovered thanks to @TessaDare that when you like a tweet with the #Bridgerton hashtag, the heart turns into a B and then a 🐝 !!
I've just watched episode S02 | E08 of Bridgerton! #bridgerton https://t.co/XSBYBXZaIB #tvtime https://t.co/IfIWefNZ6Q
the fact that they took out Kate's fear of storms and my fav library scene 💔
#Bridgerton
So who gone be the next most suitable bachelorette but secretly gay on #Bridgerton lol we need to spice this up
Eu tô amando essa temporada tá diferente dos livros? Sim, mas a história está envolvente não consigo parar de assistir #Bridgerton
CARA EU ENTENDI TUDOOOOOO, SHONDANAS VOCÊ É UM GENIO!!!!!! #Bridgerton
Kate saw Aubrey Hall and she was impressed! #Bridgerton #BridgertonS2
Watching #Bridgerton and you can't convince me that all of these costumes don't look better/best on melaninated skin.
Anthony was about to faint when Kate walked down the aisle. Hot tears. He’s spending the ceremony staring at her. This wedding is stressful. I’m stressed. #Bridgerton
Fui assistir um episódio com o grupo de rp de Bridgerton no Rave e no final meti um Evidências, nunca esquecerei 
#Bridgerton
I cannot believe that Edwina is this oblivious urrrggggg #Bridgerton
I’d forgotten how unfortunate of a puppet Edwina is. #Bridgerton
Big up Auntie Shonda for the new season of #Bridgerton

Pra quem não leu os livros a série tá perfeita.. quem leu e é fã tá puto 🤣🤣🤣 eu tô tentando me conformar (mas a série tá boa msm, só mudaram tudo dos livros kkkkkkkk) #Bridgerton
are you telling me that we would've dropped the Edwina business and moved on to Kate the one he's actually attracted to if only Anthony was less competitive LMAO #Bridgerton https://t.co/CeGmJjFiXp
They are literally stuck in the mud and it’s adorable. #Bridgerton
They were right, there's not enough boinking, but Enemies-to-Lovers couples turn on every light on my tree. #Bridgerton 

Also, Mondrich is still the hot one.
he’s just a bit unwell #Bridgerton https://t.co/s8QjTqGlJ1
Deveria ser considerado crime o que fizeram nessa segunda temporada de #Bridgerton
#Bridgerton so right, so true https://t.co/qTcuarMBX6
Segunda temporada de #Bridgerton 😍❤️ !!!!

Season 2 is not playing👏🏾👏🏾 #Bridgerton
I applaud #Bridgerton ep2 to get me to go from cackling to my heart racing within the span of 5min.

That's some good af romantic tension 🫠
Minor #Bridgerton casting spoiler, I suppose, but my new headcanon is that the Sheffield fortune will end up bankrolling the Greyhounds of AFC Richmond. #TedLasso
I love all the #Bridgerton boys…I can’t even pick a favorite 🖤🖤🖤 https://t.co/mtSPy4Rqqk
Istg if they don't give me season 3 I'll screammmmm 
#Bridgerton
Será que esse pessoal que tá decepcionado com a ADAPTAÇÃO de Bridgerton, conhece Fallen? #Bridgerton
As someone who HAS actually made the choice between family and marriage to a man you love… it’s absolutely worth it. Marry for love. #Bridgerton
